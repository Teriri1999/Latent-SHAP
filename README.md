# Manifold-based Shapley Explanations for High Dimensional Correlated Features
This repository contains the code implementation of the paper "Manifold-based Shapley Explanations for High Dimensional Correlated Features."

## Dataset
MNIST dataset;
MNIST dataset;

## backbone
Our work is based on [stylegan2](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) which used as a manifold learning approach.

GAN inversion part uses [Image2stylegan](https://github.com/zaidbhat1234/Image2StyleGAN).

## Usage
### Train StyleGAN2
### Implement Latent SHAP
